# Esp32-Data-Logger
DHT11 Sensor Reading Temperature &amp; Humidity and Storing Data into Google Sheets via Internet using ESP32

Iâ€™m excited to share a recent project where I integrated a DHT11 sensor with an ESP32 microcontroller to log temperature and humidity data into a Google Sheet in real time!

# Project Overview
- DHT11 Sensor Measures temperature and humidity accurately.
- ESP32 Handles Wi-Fi connectivity and data processing, transmitting sensor data to the cloud.

 Data is automatically updated and stored in a Google Sheet, providing easy access and analysis from anywhere.

This setup enables seamless remote monitoring of environmental data, making it ideal for agriculture, smart homes, and environmental monitoring.

# Key Benefits:
- Real-time Data Logging: View and analyze live data remotely.
- Cloud Storage: Secure and accessible data in Google Sheets.
- IoT in Action: Harnessing the power of ESP32 and the internet for smart data management.
